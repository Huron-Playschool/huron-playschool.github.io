			<p>
				Families can enrol in summer camps on a monthly basis during July and August, excluding the final two weeks of summer before the start of the school year. Our summer camp runs as a full day program and does not have a built in naptime.
			</p>
			<p>
				During summer camp, there are extended times of outdoor play at the green spaces and playgrounds located near the school. Wednesdays include outdoor waterplay (sprinkler, squeeze bottles, water toys, etc). Each week will have a theme as well.
			</p>				
			<p>
				Just as in our regular program, children are encouraged to care for each other and their environment, play co-operatively, develop their independence, and communicate their needs and interests. Children learn at Playschool through outdoor play, exploration in nature, gross motor movement, art, and sensory and imaginative play. We have a lot of fun together!
