			<p>
				Families can enrol in the nursery program for mornings only or for the full day. Children are encouraged to care for each other and their environment, play co-operatively, develop their independence, and communicate their needs and interests. Children learn at Playschool through outdoor play, exploration in nature, gross motor movement, art, and sensory and imaginative play. We have a lot of fun together!
			</p>
			<p>
				The programs includes regular excursions to local green spaces and parks. We will soon return to including a weekly movement and music class in the morning program and visits from science educators, animal handlers and others as it is safe to do so based on Covid regulations. Regular field trips will include outings to libraries, museums, and special events.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our Nursery School runs from September - June. The centre is closed for two weeks during winter break, which aligns with Toronto Public School's schedule, and during regular statutory holidays. While our regular daycare program does not run during the summer, we do offer monthly summer school enrolment to existing students with the exception of the last two weeks in August. Enrolment for any of our programs may begin at any time during the school year, and fees will be prorated accordingly.
